# MISHProj
	MISH/MASH stands for: 
	"Multiple Integrated Shortened Hyperlink/Multiple Accumulated Shortened Hyperlinks"
	Essentially, it will be a service that takes multiple links of any length, and shortens them
	into one small one.
	
	eg: 3 links to various pages for a student's research into a single "mishm.ash" link (domain pending)

## Usage
	User will go to the mishmash.com webpage (domain pending) and paste various links into the site
	then, with a press of a button, have a shortened link generated for them that, when pressed,
	open up tabs with each link inside of it. The user may also decide for how long the shortened link is
	available (24h, 48h, 7 days, permanent, etc.), and who may edit it (a list of users, think google docs)

## Developing
	Main Programmer: Zachary Luck
